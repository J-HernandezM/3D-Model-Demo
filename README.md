# 3D MODEL DEMONSTRATION

Just a simple demonstration of a 3D Model implemented on web wich allows to rotate and have a better look of a model. 

A potential use for this feature could be 3d view of products in e-commerce, navigate around a 3d model of a house or a building, among others.
You can see the preview of a simple 3D Model [here](https://j-hernandezm.github.io/3D-Model-Demo/)
